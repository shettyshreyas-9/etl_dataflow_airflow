# ETL Project with Data Fusion, Airflow, and BigQuery

This repository contains code and configuration files for an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) project using Google Cloud Dataflow for transformation & loading, Apache Airflow using Compute Engine VM for orchestration, and Google BigQuery for data loading.


## Overview

The project aims to perform the following tasks:

1. **Data Extraction**: Extract data using python.
2. **Data Transformation**: Basic transformation in Cloud Dataflow before loading it into BigQuery.
3. **Data Loading**: Load transformed data into Google BigQuery tables.
4. **Orchestration**: Automate complete Data pipeline using Airflow (Cloud Compute Engine)
